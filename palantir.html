  <h1>The Palantír: Seeing Stones and Surveillance</h1>

  <p>
    The <strong>Palantíri</strong>, or "seeing stones," were ancient and powerful artifacts used for long-distance communication and observation in Middle-earth. While created to be tools of knowledge and connection, their use came with risks. When misused—or when one stone became corrupted, as happened under Sauron’s influence—they became gateways for manipulation, misinformation, and constant surveillance.
  </p>

  <p>
    In today’s world, the Palantír feels eerily similar to our screens, feeds, and connected devices. Tools designed for openness and visibility can easily become mechanisms for control. Just as Saruman was subtly influenced by what he saw (and thought he knew), modern users can be swayed by curated information, filtered perspectives, and unseen algorithms.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ethical dilemma of the Palantír lies in **who is watching, and who controls the narrative**. Transparency and oversight become essential. Just like the characters in Tolkien’s world, we must ask: when we gaze into our own Palantír, are we learning the truth—or only what someone wants us to see?
