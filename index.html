            <h2>The Invisibility Cloak</h2>
            <img src="invisibility-cloak.jpg" alt="Invisibility Cloak" class="artifact-image">
            <p>The Invisibility Cloak, passed down to Harry Potter from his father, allows the wearer to become invisible to the naked eye. While it serves as a powerful tool for stealth and secrecy, it raises significant privacy concerns. Should anyone have the power to move undetected in spaces where others assume privacy? In a modern context, this parallels the debate on surveillance and privacy rights. Much like an invisibility cloak, advanced surveillance technology today allows for “invisible” monitoring, often raising ethical questions about consent and transparency.</p>

            <h2>The Marauder's Map</h2>
            <img src="marauders-map.jpg" alt="Marauder's Map" class="artifact-image">
            <p>The Marauder's Map, enchanted to show the location of every individual within Hogwarts in real-time, is a fascinating yet invasive tool. While it aids in detecting dangers or mischievous activities, it also eliminates all personal privacy within its range. This artifact draws a parallel to GPS tracking and real-time location-sharing technology in our world. Who should have access to such information, and under what conditions? In the wrong hands, it could lead to breaches of privacy, bullying, and loss of autonomy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Veritaserum</h2>
            <img src="veritaserum.jpg" alt="Veritaserum" class="artifact-image">
            <p>Veritaserum, a powerful truth serum in the wizarding world, forces individuals to speak the truth. While potentially useful in interrogations or uncovering secrets, the use of Veritaserum raises ethical concerns about consent, autonomy, and the right to withhold personal information. In our world, this raises questions similar to debates about lie detection technologies and their implications for privacy and human rights.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Legilimency</h2>
            <img src="legilimency.jpg" alt="Legilimency" class="artifact-image">
            <p>Legilimency, or the magical ability to read another person’s mind, is another form of intrusion that can severely impact individual privacy. While practiced by powerful wizards like Snape and Voldemort, it forces a person to reveal their innermost thoughts against their will. In a modern context, this ability mirrors concerns around invasive psychological profiling and brainwave tracking technologies, which could one day infringe upon mental privacy.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways: Balancing Magic and Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Harry Potter universe highlights the powerful capabilities of magical tools while raising ethical and privacy questions that resonate with issues in our world. Should such tools be restricted, and if so, how? As we develop more powerful technologies, it’s essential to consider their implications and strive to protect individual privacy. While magic and technology evolve, the need to balance utility with ethical responsibility remains universal.</p>
